# Regression cover for the linked-worktree install guard in bin/build-adapters.sh.
#
# Why it exists: $SRC is the script's own parent, and the Claude adapter @imports
# the global files BY PATH. Installing from a linked worktree therefore rewrites
# every registered account's CLAUDE.md to import from that worktree -- a path that
# dies with the worktree, and a missing @import target is SILENT. Observed
# 2026-09-03; recovered by re-running from the primary checkout.
#
# Isolation: this clones the repository under test and adds the worktree inside
# the CLONE, so the real repository's worktree list is never touched. $HOME is a
# throwaway, so account resolution (git config --global) finds only the default.
