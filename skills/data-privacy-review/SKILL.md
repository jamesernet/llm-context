description: Review how a system collects, stores, shares, and deletes personal data — PII inventory, retention, deletion paths, DSAR readiness, residency, processors. Use when code or schemas touch user personal data, emails, analytics, tracking, third-party data sharing, or GDPR/CCPA questions come up.

# Data Privacy Review

How I audit a system's handling of personal data. Output: a findings list
ranked by severity, plus the PII inventory if one doesn't exist — the
inventory is usually the deliverable that unlocks everything else.

## Procedure

### 1. Inventory
For each category of personal data: what is collected, where it lives
(every store: DB, warehouse, logs, analytics, error tracker, backups,
spreadsheets), why it's needed, and who can access it. If the honest
answer to "why" is "we might need it," that's collection without purpose —
a finding.

### 2. Minimization and purpose
- Collect the minimum for the stated purpose; derived/enriched data counts.
- Purpose creep check: is data collected for X being used for Y
  (especially marketing, analytics, or model training)?
- Special categories (health, biometrics, precise location, children's
  data) get flagged separately — higher bar everywhere.

### 3. Retention and deletion — the part that's always broken
- Every data category has a retention period and an *implemented* deletion
  path. A policy document without a cron job is a finding.
- Deletion must reach the long tail: replicas, warehouse, logs, analytics,
  error trackers, search indexes, caches, backups (document the backup
  expiry story — "deleted on restore" needs an actual mechanism), and any
  third party the data was shared with.
- Anonymization claims get scrutiny: if it can be re-linked, it's
  pseudonymized, and it's still personal data.

### 4. DSAR readiness
Can the team, today, for one user: export everything (access/portability),
correct it, and delete it — within the statutory window (30 days GDPR, 45
CCPA)? Walk the actual mechanism, not the intention. Verify the requester's
identity before disclosing anything.

### 5. Processors and transfers
- Every third party receiving personal data: DPA in place, purpose bound,
  deletion propagated. This includes analytics, support tooling, and **AI
  vendors — prompts containing user data are a data transfer**.
- Cross-border transfers have a lawful mechanism (SCCs/adequacy);
  residency requirements (data must stay in region X) are architecture
  constraints, so surface them early.

### 6. Security posture (privacy-relevant slice)
Encryption in transit and at rest, access on least privilege with audit
logs on PII access, and a breach-notification path with owners and clocks
(72h GDPR). Deeper security review belongs to threat-model.

## Red flags — instant findings
- PII in application logs or error trackers (emails, tokens, addresses).
- User data in prompts to third-party AI services with no DPA/opt-out.
- "Soft delete" as the only delete.
- Analytics/tracking firing before consent where consent is required.
- One database role that every service and employee shares.
