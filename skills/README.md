# Skills

Personal, in-development skill set. Each skill is a flat directory with a `SKILL.md`
(Claude Code does **not** discover nested category folders), so the grouping below is
organizational only.

**Workflow:** these live in the `llm-context` repo (version-controlled) and are installed
into each account's `skills/<name>/` by `bin/install-skills.sh` — managed copies by default,
symlinks under `--dev` so edits take effect immediately. A project-local `.claude/skills/` is
**additive**: it cannot hide a globally installed skill.

**Bundles:** [`bundles.conf`](bundles.conf) decides which skills a class of project actually
installs (`core`, `website`, `webapp`, `platform`, `fintech`, `cloudflare`, or `all`). Every
skill below must appear in at least one bundle — `bin/lint-skills.sh` enforces it, because a
skill in no bundle silently installs only under `all`.

`/name` = user-invocable. "auto" = can also self-trigger from the description's trigger phrases
(skills marked `disable-model-invocation: true` are user-invoked only).

## engineering
| skill | invoke | what it does |
|---|---|---|

## agent-handoff
| skill | invoke | what it does |
|---|---|---|

| [grab](grab/) | `/grab` | issue → worktree → brief → implement, one motion; built for parallel sessions |

## dependencies (pulled to close the graph)
These are referenced by the skills above; imported so the set is self-contained.
| skill | invoke | needed by |
|---|---|---|
| [codebase-design](codebase-design/) | auto | improve-codebase-architecture, tdd (module/seam/depth vocabulary) |
| [setup-skills](setup-skills/) | `/setup-skills` | to-prd, to-issues, triage (per-project tracker + label config) |
| [triage](triage/) | `/triage` | front-end of the intake→triage→prd→issues pipeline |

_`review` was dropped 2026-07 — `implement` uses the built-in `/code-review`; it lives in git history if ever needed._
