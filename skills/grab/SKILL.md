# Grab

Connects the pipeline's pieces into one motion: issue → worktree → brief →
implementation. Designed so several grabs can run in parallel, one agent
session per worktree.

## Procedure

1. **Resolve the work item.** `/grab <issue-id>` fetches the issue from the
   repo's tracker (which tracker: see the repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and
   [setup-skills](../setup-skills/)). `/grab` with no argument: list open,
   unassigned, ready-labeled issues and ask which one. If pointed at an
   existing brief file, use it directly.

2. **Qualify before building.** Read the issue. If it lacks what
   [AGENT-BRIEF](../triage/AGENT-BRIEF.md) requires — context, constraints,
   verification criteria — apply [interview-me](../interview-me/) to close the gaps
   (asking the user or the issue thread) rather than guessing. A brief
   without "done means…" is not grabbable yet.

3. **Create the workspace.** Branch name `feature/<issue-id>-<slug>` (or
   `fix/…`), then create the worktree. **Use the repo's own helper if it ships
   one** — `scripts/new-worktree.sh <branch>` and similar encode that repo's base
   branch, location convention and pre-flight checks (core-api's fetches
   `origin/main` first, because a stale base is how you author a migration
   chaining off a superseded head). Fall back to
   `llm-context/bin/worktree.sh new <branch>` only where the repo ships nothing.
   All subsequent work happens inside that worktree, leaving the main checkout
   free for parallel grabs.

4. **Record the working brief where THIS repo keeps briefs**, per the
   AGENT-BRIEF format, and note on the tracker issue that it's been grabbed
   (assignee/label per repo convention). **Check the repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md
   before creating a file for it.** Some repos commit briefs under
   `docs/briefs/`; others have retired that path deliberately and gitignore it,
   because a brief that restates its ticket is a second copy free to drift — in
   those, the brief IS the ticket, working notes stay local and uncommitted, and
   there is nothing to write. Never create a briefs directory a repo does not
   already use.

5. **Implement** via [implement](../implement/), honoring the brief's
   verification criteria as the definition of done. On completion or when
   stopping mid-flight, write a handoff per [handoff](../handoff/) so any
   agent — or a human — can resume.

## Rules
- One grab = one branch = one worktree = one brief. No batching.
- Never grab onto main/master; the worktree step makes this structural.
- If the tracker and the brief file disagree, the tracker wins (see the
  global handoff-and-briefs conventions).
