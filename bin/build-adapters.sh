#   ~/.codex/AGENTS.md    Codex — no @import, so the files are concatenated inline.
#
# Claude output is built into EVERY registered account (bin/lib/accounts.sh),
# not just ~/.claude, because the alternative is what actually happened: a
# second account was created, the installer kept writing only to the first, and
# nothing reported a problem. Codex has no account concept, so its adapter is
# built once.
#
# Each account gets its OWN hooks/ rather than referencing the default
# account's. A cross-account path works until that directory is reset or moved,
# and then leaves a silently unwired safety hook — which is indistinguishable
# from a working one until the day it should have fired.
#
# Public website copies are a separate concern. Use
# bin/sync-published-context.sh so installing agent configuration never creates
# or edits unrelated repository paths.

# Versioned Claude Code settings (portable safety hooks). Source of truth for the
# keys it DECLARES; ~/.claude/settings.json is merged from it, not overwritten.
#
# The distinction matters. This file previously ended in `cp src dest`, which
# destroyed every local key the repo did not declare — `theme`, `statusLine`,
# anything Claude Code writes about its own UI. Those are machine-local
# preferences (a dark theme is right in an office and wrong in a bright hotel
# room), so versioning them is wrong, but silently deleting them on every
# rebuild is worse.
#
# So: repo values win for keys the repo declares; every other local key is left
# alone, and --check only compares the declared ones. The invariant is unchanged
# — this repo is still the single source of truth for what it manages — it just
# no longer claims ownership of things it never had an opinion about.

# jq's `*` is recursive for OBJECTS only. For every other type — arrays
# included — the right operand simply replaces the left. `hooks.PreToolUse` is
# an array, so `local * repo` silently discarded every locally-added hook entry
# and left only the one this repo declares.
#
# That is not theoretical. A machine-local account guard sat second in that
# array; the next `install.sh` would have deleted it, and `doctor` was already
# recommending exactly that command to clear the drift the extra entry caused.
# An unwired safety hook fails silently and looks identical to a working one.
#
# So hook arrays are merged by UNION on the hook SCRIPT NAME: this repo's
# entries are authoritative and come first, and any local entry naming a script
# this repo does not ship survives untouched. Same invariant as the top-level
# keys — the repo owns what it declares and nothing else — applied one level
# deeper.
#
# On the script NAME rather than the full path, because an account created by
# copying another carries the original's hook paths. Those entries are this
# repo's own, just pointing at the wrong account, and matching on the full path
# would leave the stale one in place beside the corrected one — the same guard
# wired twice. Matching on the basename re-points it instead.
#
# Not on the MATCHER, because two entries legitimately share one: that is how
# you attach two independent guards to the same tools.
