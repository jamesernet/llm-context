# Installs the local git backstop (bin/git-hooks/pre-commit) into repos so that
# commits on main/master are blocked regardless of who or what is committing.
# This is the everywhere-backstop for the "branch before you build" rule — the
# Claude PreToolUse hook only covers Claude; this covers Codex and humans too.

#
# Middle-path install (safe for client repos):
#   - If the repo already has a pre-commit hook that isn't ours, it's preserved
#     as pre-commit.local, and our hook execs it after the branch check passes —
#     the repo's own checks keep running.
#   - Re-running is idempotent: our hook is recognised by its "llmctx-hook"
#     marker and simply refreshed in place.
#   - Repos where a hook framework has set core.hooksPath (husky, lefthook) are
#     SKIPPED with a warning: copying into .git/hooks there would be silently
#     inert. Add the branch check through that framework's config instead.
#
# The hook is copied into each repo's git hooks dir (local, not committed).
# Re-run after cloning a repo fresh. Linked worktrees share the main repo's
# hooks, so installing once covers all of a repo's worktrees.
