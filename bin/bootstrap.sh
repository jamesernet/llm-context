# One-command setup on a new machine (after cloning this repo):
#   bin/bootstrap.sh
#   bin/bootstrap.sh --account <name>    just one Claude account
#
# 1. installs versioned copies of all skills (skills/ + vendor/) into
#    <account>/skills and ~/.codex/skills
# 2. installs the branch backstop + this repo's own pre-commit checks
#    (lint-skills + build-adapters --check) into THIS repo's .git/hooks
# 3. builds the tool adapters (<account>/CLAUDE.md, ~/.codex/AGENTS.md)
#    and installs the versioned <account>/settings.json
#
# <account> is every registered Claude config directory, always including
# ~/.claude. See bin/lib/accounts.sh and `llmctx account list`.
#
# ADAPTERS GO LAST, AND A FAILURE THERE DOES NOT ABORT THE REST. They used to run
# first, under `set -e`, so build-adapters.sh refusing to install from a linked
# worktree exited here with the branch backstop and every skill NOT installed --
# while the error text talked only about CLAUDE.md @import paths. A guard that
# leaves you less protected than before, reporting a different problem, is the
# wrong trade. Now the backstop is in place before adapters are attempted, and
# the summary below names what did not happen.
#
# Not covered here (per-repo, run where needed):
#   bin/install-git-hooks.sh   pre-commit branch protection for other repos
