# Verify that what a repository DECLARES it needs actually resolves on this
# machine. Read-only, no network, no credentials.
#
# Why resolution and not credentials: a repo names an AWS profile, the profile
# is missing from ~/.aws/config here, and the first symptom is an opaque error
# from a command run twenty minutes later. Naming the gap costs a second.
# Whether the profile still has valid credentials only using it can tell you,
# and finding that out is a deploy, not a check.
#
# It never sources .envrc. Sourcing would run arbitrary code from the repo
# during a check, which is the one thing a check must not do.
#
#   llmctx env check [repo]      findings, non-zero if any require attention
#   llmctx env explain [repo]    the declaration, its target, and what is manual
